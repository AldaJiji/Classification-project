# Classification Project

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using a dataset containing various customer 
attributes and their churn status. We employed three different machine learning models to achieve this: Random Forest Classifier, 
Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). 
The goal is to identify whether a customer will churn based on their profile and behavior.
