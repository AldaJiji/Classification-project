# Classification Project

This project aims to predict customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company using a [dataset](churn.xlsx)  containing various customer attributes and their churn status. 
More information can be found [here](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

The goal is to create a model to predict whether or not a customer will churn based on their profile and behavior.
To achieve this, we employed three different machine learning models : Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). 


# Notebook contente

1. Import Necessary Libraries, Reading, Exploring and Preparing Data
2. Create Random Forest Classifier model
3. Create Logistic Regression model
4. Create Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model
5. Make prediction
   - We chose one model and tested it on a sample customer to predict the likelihood of churn.
